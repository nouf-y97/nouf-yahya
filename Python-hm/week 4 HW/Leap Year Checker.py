# Problem 2: Leap Year Checker
# ----------------------------
# A year is a leap year if:
#   - It is divisible by 4, AND
#   - It is NOT divisible by 100, UNLESS it is divisible by 400.
# Ask the user for a year and print "Leap Year" or "Not a Leap Year".
# Constraint: You may NOT use 'and' or 'or'. Use nested if statements.
