# Problem 4: Number Sign and Magnitude
# ------------------------------------
# Ask the user for a number and print:
#   - "Negative large"  if the number is less than -100
#   - "Negative small"  if the number is between -100 and 0 (not 0)
#   - "Zero"            if the number is exactly 0
#   - "Positive small"  if the number is between 0 and 100 (not 0)
#   - "Positive large"  if the number is greater than 100
# Constraint: NO logical operators. Use ordered elif branches.
